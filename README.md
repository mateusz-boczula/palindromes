# palindromes

This project performs a search for at most three longest palindromes in the input string, printing out their value, indexes of their first characters and the length of a palindrome string.

## Project setup
This project has been implemented in Scala (version 2.12.2), using SBT as the build tool.

## How to run
In order to perform a palindrome search please do the following steps:
* Start the command line and go to the project root folder
* Type the following command "sbt run input-string", replacing the "input-string" text with the source text you want to search for palindromes. for example "sbt run racecar" to search the text "racecar"
* Observe the program's output for results
